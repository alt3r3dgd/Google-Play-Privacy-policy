# Ads
The apps use Google Mobile Ads SDK for Unity to display ads. This SDK collects users' other apps usage data, age, gender etc. Not your name or password, obviously. The Google Mobile Ads SDK is a Google Play sertificied ad network (since it's Google's) and it can't use your data in wrong ways.
